## Sites

import ShowcaseSites from '../../components/showcase-sites.astro';

Starlight is already being used in production. These are some of the sites around the web:

<ShowcaseSites />

See all the [public project repos using Starlight on GitHub](https://github.com/withastro/starlight/network/dependents).

## Community plugins

import { CardGrid, LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

These community tools, plugins, and integrations work alongside Starlight to extend its functionality.
