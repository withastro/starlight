## Sites

import ShowcaseSites from '../../components/showcase-sites.astro';

Starlight is already being used in production. These are some of the sites around the web:

<ShowcaseSites />

See all the [public project repos using Starlight on GitHub](https://github.com/withastro/starlight/network/dependents).

## Plugins

[Plugins](/reference/plugins/) can customize Starlight configuration, UI, and behavior, while also being easy to share and reuse.
Extend your site with official plugins supported by the Starlight team and community plugins maintained by Starlight users.
