See all the [public project repos using Starlight on GitHub](https://github.com/withastro/starlight/network/dependents).

## Plugins

Starlight [plugins](/reference/plugins/) can customize Starlight configuration, UI, and behavior, while also being easy to share and reuse.
This section lists the official plugins supported by the Starlight team and also community plugins that are maintained by Starlight users.
