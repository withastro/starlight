		I used Starlight in my last job and loved it. Great components, intuitive
		design, and super-responsive community (whenever anyone needed something,
		they’d ship it soonish or tell you a workaround). Very pleasant experience.

    Starlight has been a game-changer for me, allowing me to focus on the content creation without getting bogged down by technicalities.

    Its intuitive design not only streamlines my workflow but also reduces onboarding time for open-source developers, enabling them to contribute seamlessly in Markdown format without the need to grapple with complex tools.

    Starlight is my go-to tool for documentation. It made it super easy to add docs to my existing Astro product website, vs needing a subdomain to use with another tool.

    Spent some more time with Starlight for the Course Builder docs and it’s been great so far. Lots of nice touches and can focus on writing in Markdown and not fiddling with the site.
