    Starlight has been a game-changer for me, allowing me to focus on content creation.

    Its intuitive design not only streamlines my workflow but also reduces onboarding time for open-source developers.

    Spent some more time with Starlight for the Course Builder docs and it’s been great so far. Lots of nice touches and can focus on writing in Markdown and not fiddling with the site.

    Starlight is the best way to get started with documentation, between the
    power and speed of Astro, and the tooling from Starlight, it’s a match in
    heaven.

    It has been my go to for a while now, and I keep on loving it!

    I used Starlight in my last job and loved it. Great components, intuitive
    design, and super-responsive community (whenever anyone needed something,
    they’d ship it soonish or tell you a workaround). Very pleasant experience.

    Starlight is my go-to tool for documentation. It made it super easy to add docs to my existing Astro product website, vs needing a subdomain to use with another tool.
