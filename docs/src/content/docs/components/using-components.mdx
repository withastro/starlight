Components let you easily reuse a piece of UI or styling consistently.
Examples might include a link card or a YouTube embed.
Starlight supports the use of components in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) and [Markdoc](https://markdoc.dev/) files and provides some common components for you to use.

[Learn more about building components in the Astro Docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-components/).

## Using a component in MDX

You can use a component by importing it into your MDX file and then rendering it as a JSX tag.
These look like HTML tags but start with an uppercase letter matching the name in your `import` statement:

```mdx
---
# src/content/docs/example.mdx
title: Welcome to my docs
---

import SomeComponent from '../../components/SomeComponent.astro';
import AnotherComponent from '../../components/AnotherComponent.astro';

<SomeComponent prop="something" />

<AnotherComponent>
	Components can also contain **nested content**.
</AnotherComponent>
```

Because Starlight is powered by Astro, you can add support for components built with any [supported UI framework (React, Preact, Svelte, Vue, Solid, Lit, and Alpine)](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/framework-components/) in your MDX files.
Learn more about [using components in MDX](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#using-components-in-mdx) in the Astro docs.

## Using a component in Markdoc

Starlight supports authoring content in [Markdoc](/guides/authoring-content/#markdoc).
Check the experimental [Astro Markdoc integration documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/markdoc/#render-components) for more information on how to use components in Markdoc files.

## Built-in components

Starlight provides some built-in components for common documentation use cases.
These components are available from the `@astrojs/starlight/components` package in MDX files and from the [Starlight Markdoc preset](/guides/authoring-content/#markdoc) in Markdoc files.

See the components group in the sidebar for a list of available components and how to use them.

## Compatibility with Starlight’s styles

Starlight applies default styling to your Markdown content, for example adding margin between elements.
If these styles conflict with your component’s appearance, set the `not-content` class on your component to disable them.

```astro 'class="not-content"'
---
// src/components/Example.astro
---

<div class="not-content">
	<p>Not impacted by Starlight’s default content styling.</p>
</div>
```

## Component props

Use the [`ComponentProps`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/typescript/#componentprops-type) type from `astro/types` to reference the `Props` accepted by a component even if they are not exported by the component.

The following example uses `ComponentProps` to reference the props accepted by a `Callout` component:

```astro
---
// src/components/Example.astro
import type { ComponentProps } from 'astro/types';
import Callout from './Callout.astro';

type CalloutProps = ComponentProps<typeof Callout>;
---
```
