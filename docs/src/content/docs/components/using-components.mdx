Components let you easily reuse a piece of UI or styling consistently.
Examples might include a link card or a YouTube embed.
Starlight supports the use of components in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) and [Markdoc](https://markdoc.dev/) files and provides some common components for you to use.

[Learn more about building components in the Astro Docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-components/).

## Using a component in MDX

You can use a component by importing it into your MDX file and then rendering it as a JSX tag.
These look like HTML tags but start with an uppercase letter matching the name in your `import` statement:

```mdx
---
# src/content/docs/example.mdx
title: Welcome to my docs
---

import { Icon } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import CustomCard from '../../components/CustomCard.astro';

<Icon name="open-book" />

<CustomCard>Components can also contain **nested content**.</CustomCard>
```

Because Starlight is powered by Astro, you can add support for components built with any [supported UI framework (React, Preact, Svelte, Vue, Solid, and Alpine)](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/framework-components/) in your MDX files.
Learn more about [using components in MDX](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/#using-components-in-mdx) in the Astro docs.

## Using a component in Markdoc

Add support for authoring content in Markdoc by following our [Markdoc set-up guide](/guides/authoring-content/#markdoc).

Using the Starlight Markdoc preset, you can use Starlight’s built-in components with Markdoc’s `{% %}` tag syntax.
Unlike MDX, components in Markdoc do not need to be imported.
The following example renders Starlight’s [card component](/components/cards/) in a Markdoc file:

```markdoc
---
# src/content/docs/example.mdoc
title: Welcome to my docs
---

{% card title="Stars" icon="star" %}
Sirius, Vega, Betelgeuse
{% /card %}
```

See the [Astro Markdoc integration documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/markdoc/#render-components) for more information on how to use components in Markdoc files.

## Built-in components

Starlight provides built-in components for common documentation use cases.
These components are available from the `@astrojs/starlight/components` package in MDX files and from the [Starlight Markdoc preset](/guides/authoring-content/#markdoc) in Markdoc files.

See the sidebar for a list of available components and how to use them.

## Compatibility with Starlight’s styles

Starlight applies default styling to your Markdown content, for example, adding margin between elements.
If these styles conflict with your component’s appearance, set the `not-content` class on your component to disable them.

```astro 'class="not-content"'
---
// src/components/Example.astro
---

<div class="not-content">
	<p>Not impacted by Starlight’s default content styling.</p>
</div>
```

## Component props

Use the [`ComponentProps`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/typescript/#componentprops-type) type from `astro/types` to reference the `Props` accepted by a component even if they are not exported by the component itself.
This can be helpful when wrapping or extending an existing component.

The following example uses `ComponentProps` to get the type of the props accepted by Starlight’s built-in `Icon` component:

```astro
---
// src/components/Example.astro
import type { ComponentProps } from 'astro/types';
import { Icon } from '@astrojs/starlight/icon';

type IconProps = ComponentProps<typeof Icon>;
---
```
