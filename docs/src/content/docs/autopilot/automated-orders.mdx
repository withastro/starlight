Automated orders help you set up automated trading rules that execute based on market conditions, allowing you to implement your strategy without constant market monitoring.

## Stop Loss Orders

Stop loss orders help protect your investments by automatically selling when prices fall below your specified threshold.

- **How it works**: You set a price threshold below the current market price
- **Execution**: When the market price reaches or falls below your stop price, Axal attempts to sell your position
- **Protection**: Helps limit potential losses during market downturns

## Limit Orders

Limit orders let you automatically buy or sell when assets reach your target price.

- **Buy Limits**: Set orders to buy when prices fall to your desired level
- **Sell Limits**: Set orders to sell when prices rise to your target
- **Market Execution**: Orders execute based on market availability and liquidity

## Additional notes

- All orders are subject to market availability
- Execution prices may vary from set prices due to market conditions
- Orders remain active until filled or cancelled
