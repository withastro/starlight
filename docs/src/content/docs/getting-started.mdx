import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

:::caution[Work in progress]
Starlight is in early development.
If you find something that’s not working, [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/withastro/starlight/issues/new/choose) or let us know on [Discord](https://astro.build/chat).

## Creating a new project

Starlight is a full-featured documentation theme built on top of the [Astro](https://astro.build) framework.

You can create a new Astro + Starlight project using the following command:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
# create a new project with npm
npm create astro@latest -- --template starlight
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
# create a new project with pnpm
pnpm create astro --template starlight
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Yarn">

```sh
# create a new project with yarn
yarn create astro --template starlight
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will create a new [project directory](/guides/project-structure/) with all the necessary files and configurations for your site.

:::tip[See it in action]

## Creating content with Starlight

Starlight is ready for you to add new content, or bring your existing files!

### File formats

Starlight supports authoring content in Markdown and MDX. (You can add support for Markdoc by installing the experimental [Astro Markdoc integration](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/markdoc/).)

### Add pages

Add new pages to your site automatically by creating `.md` or `.mdx` files in `src/content/docs/`. Add sub-folders to organize your files, and to create multiple path segments:

```
src/content/docs/hello-world.md => your-site.com/hello-world
src/content/docs/guides/faq.md => your-site.com/guides/faq
```

### Type-safe frontmatter

All Starlight pages share a customizable [common set of frontmatter properties](/reference/frontmatter/) to control how the page appears:

```md
---
title: Hello, World!
description: This is a page in my Starlight-powered site
---
```

If you forget anything important, Starlight will let you know.

## Deploying your Starlight website

Once you have created and customized your Starlight website, you can deploy it to a web server or hosting platform of your choice including Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages and many more.

## Updating Starlight

:::tip
Because Starlight is beta software, there will be frequent updates and improvements. Be sure to update Starlight regularly!

Starlight is an Astro integration, and is updated like any `@astrojs/*` integration:

```sh
# upgrade Starlight with npm
npm install @astrojs/starlight@latest
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
# upgrade Starlight with pnpm
pnpm upgrade @astrojs/starlight --latest
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Yarn">
