## Creating a new project

Starlight is a full-featured documentation theme built on top of the [Astro](https://astro.build) framework.

You can create a new Astro + Starlight project using the following command:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
# create a new project with npm
npm create astro@latest -- --template starlight
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
# create a new project with pnpm
pnpm create astro --template starlight
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Yarn">

```sh
# create a new project with yarn
yarn create astro --template starlight
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will create a new [project directory](/guides/project-structure/) with all the necessary files and configurations for your site.

## Creating content with Starlight

Starlight is ready for you to add new content, or bring your existing files!

### File formats

Starlight supports authoring content in Markdown and MDX. (You can add support for Markdoc by installing the experimental [Astro Markdoc integration](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/markdoc/).)

### Add pages

Add new pages to your site automatically by creating `.md` or `.mdx` files in `src/content/docs/`. Add sub-folders to organize your files, and to create multiple path segments:

```
src/content/docs/hello-world.md => your-site.com/hello-world
src/content/docs/guides/faq.md => your-site.com/guides/faq
```

### Type-safe frontmatter

All Starlight pages share a customizable [common set of frontmatter properties](/reference/frontmatter/) to control how the page appears:

```md
---
title: Hello, World!
description: This is a page in my Starlight-powered site
---
```

If you forget anything important, Starlight will let you know.

## Deploying your Starlight website

Once you have created and customized your Starlight website, you can deploy it to a web server or hosting platform of your choice including Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages and many more.

[Learn about deploying an Astro site in the Astro docs.](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/)

## Updating Starlight

:::tip
Because Starlight is beta software, there will be frequent updates and improvements. Be sure to update Starlight regularly!
:::

Starlight is an Astro integration, and is updated like any `@astrojs/*` integration:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
# upgrade Starlight with npm
npm install @astrojs/starlight@latest
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
# upgrade Starlight with pnpm
pnpm upgrade @astrojs/starlight --latest
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Yarn">

```sh
# upgrade Starlight with yarn
yarn upgrade @astrojs/starlight --latest
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can see a full list of the changes made in each release in [the Starlight changelog](https://github.com/withastro/starlight/blob/main/packages/starlight/CHANGELOG.md).

## Troubleshooting Starlight

Both Starlight [project configuration](/reference/configuration/) and [individual page frontmatter configuration](/reference/frontmatter/) information are available in the Reference section of this site. Use these pages to ensure that your Starlight site is configured and functioning properly.

See the growing list of guides in the sidebar for help adding content and customizing your Starlight site.
