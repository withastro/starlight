import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

:::caution[Work in progress]

## Creating a new project

Starlight is built on top of the [Astro](https://astro.build) all-in-one framework. You can create a new Astro + Starlight project using the following command:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
# create a new project with npm
npm create astro@latest -- --template starlight
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
# create a new project with pnpm
pnpm create astro --template starlight
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Yarn">

```sh
# create a new project with yarn
yarn create astro --template starlight
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will create a new project directory with all the necessary files and configurations for your site.

## Creating content with Starlight

Starlight supports authoring content in Markdown and MDX.

You can add new pages by creating `.md` or `.mdx` files in `src/content/docs/`. For example, `src/content/docs/hello-world.md` will be available on your site at `/hello-world`.

All Starlight pages share a [common set of frontmatter properties](/reference/frontmatter/) you can set to control how the page appears:

```md
---
title: Hello, World!
description: This is a page in my Starlight-powered site
---
```

If you forget anything important, Starlight will let you know.

## Deploying your Starlight website

Once you have created and customized your Starlight website, you can deploy it to a web server or hosting platform of your choice. Astro provides built-in support for several popular hosting platforms, including Netlify, Vercel, and GitHub Pages, which means you can deploy your website with just a few simple commands.
