## What is Axal?

Axal is building the future of how we save, leveraging stablecoins and blockchains to automate, secure, and earn on your money. Instead of keeping your money in a traditional bank, you place it in Axal. Behind the scenes, Axal automatically moves your funds to safe and reliable strategies where they can earn strong interest. It is like a savings account that constantly looks for the best available rates.

You always stay in control of your money. Axal adds an extra layer of security that reviews every transaction before it happens to protect your funds.
Axal also removes the complexity of managing digital funds.

You do not need to think about networks or transaction fees. Everything is handled for you so you can focus on the benefits.
In short, Axal is a simple and secure way to grow your money with 6 to 10 percent annual returns.
