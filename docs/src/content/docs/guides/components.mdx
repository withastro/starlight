description: Using components in MDX with Starlight.

Components let you easily reuse a piece of UI or styling consistently.
Examples might include a link card or a YouTube embed.
Starlight supports the use of components in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) files and provides some common components for you to use.

[Learn more about building components in the Astro Docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-components/).

## Using a component

You can use a component by importing it into your MDX file and then rendering it as a JSX tag.
These look like HTML tags but start with an uppercase letter matching the name in your `import` statement:

```mdx
---
# src/content/docs/index.mdx
title: Welcome to my docs
---

import SomeComponent from '../../components/SomeComponent.astro';
import AnotherComponent from '../../components/AnotherComponent.astro';

<SomeComponent prop="something" />

<AnotherComponent>
  Components can also contain **nested content**.
</AnotherComponent>
```

Because Starlight is powered by Astro, you can add support for components built with any [supported UI framework (React, Preact, Svelte, Vue, Solid, Lit, and Alpine)](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/framework-components/) in your MDX files.
Learn more about [using components in MDX](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#using-components-in-mdx) in the Astro docs.

## Built-in components

Starlight provides some built-in components for common documentation use cases.
These components are available from the `@astrojs/starlight/components` package.

### Tabs

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

You can display a tabbed interface using the `<Tabs>` and `<TabItem>` components.
Each `<TabItem>` must have a `label` to display to users.

```mdx
import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Stars">Sirius, Vega, Betelgeuse</TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Moons">Io, Europa, Ganymede</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

The code above generates the following tabs on the page:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Stars">Sirius, Vega, Betelgeuse</TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Moons">Io, Europa, Ganymede</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Cards

import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

You can display content in a box matching Starlight’s styles using the `<Card>` component.
Wrap multiple cards in the `<CardGrid>` component to display cards side-by-side when there’s enough space.

A `<Card>` requires a `title` and can optionally include an `icon` attribute set to the name of [one of Starlight’s built-in icons](https://github.com/withastro/starlight/blob/main/packages/starlight/components/Icons.ts).

```mdx
import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Card title="Check this out">Interesting content you want to highlight.</Card>

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Stars" icon="star">
    Sirius, Vega, Betelgeuse
  </Card>
  <Card title="Moons" icon="moon">
    Io, Europa, Ganymede
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
```

The code above generates the following on the page:

<Card title="Check this out">Interesting content you want to highlight.</Card>

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Stars" icon="star">
    Sirius, Vega, Betelgeuse
  </Card>
  <Card title="Moons" icon="moon">
    Io, Europa, Ganymede
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

:::tip
Use a card grid on your home page to display your project’s key features.
Add the `stagger` attribute to shift the second column of cards vertically and add visual interest:

```astro
<CardGrid stagger>
  <!-- cards -->
</CardGrid>
```
