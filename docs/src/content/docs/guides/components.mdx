description: Using components in MDX with Starlight.

Components let you easily re-use a piece of UI or styling consistently.
Examples might include a link card or a YouTube embed.
Starlight supports the use of components in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) files and provides some common components for you to use.

## Using a component

You can use a component by importing it into your MDX file and then calling it as a JSX tag.
These look like HTML tags but start with an uppercase letter matching the name in your `import` statement:

```mdx
---
# src/content/docs/index.mdx
title: Welcome to my docs
---

import SomeComponent from '../../components/SomeComponent.astro';
import AnotherComponent from '../../components/AnotherComponent.astro';

<SomeComponent prop="something" />

<AnotherComponent>
  Components can also contain **nested content**.
</AnotherComponent>
```

Because Starlight is powered by Astro, you can use components built with any UI framework in your MDX files.
Learn more about [using components in MDX](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#using-components-in-mdx) in the Astro docs.

## Built-in components

Starlight provides built-in components for common documentation use cases.
These components are available from the `@astrojs/starlight/components` package.

### Tabs

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

You can display a tabbed interface using the `<Tabs>` and `<TabItem>` components.

```mdx
import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem id="stars" label="Stars">
    Sirius, Vega, Betelgeuse
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem id="moons" label="Moons">
    Io, Europa, Ganymede
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

The code above generates the following tabs on the page:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem id="stars" label="Stars">
    Sirius, Vega, Betelgeuse
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem id="moons" label="Moons">
    Io, Europa, Ganymede
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Each `<TabItem>` must have a `label` to display to users and a unique `id`.
