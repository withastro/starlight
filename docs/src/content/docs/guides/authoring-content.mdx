title: Authoring Content in Markdown
description: An overview of the Markdown syntax Starlight supports.
---

Starlight supports the full range of [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax in `.md` files as well as frontmatter [YAML](https://dev.to/paulasantamaria/introduction-to-yaml-125f) to define metadata such as a title and description.

Please be sure to check the [MDX docs](https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx/#markdown) or [Markdoc docs](https://markdoc.dev/docs/syntax) if using those file formats, as Markdown support and usage can differ.

## Frontmatter

You can customize individual pages in Starlight by setting values in their frontmatter.
Frontmatter is set at the top of your files between `---` separators:

```md title="src/content/docs/example.md"
---
title: My page title
---

Page content follows the second `---`.
```

Every page must include at least a `title`.
See the [frontmatter reference](/reference/frontmatter/) for all available fields and how to add custom fields.

## Inline styles

Text can be **bold**, _italic_, or ~~strikethrough~~.

```md
Text can be **bold**, _italic_, or ~~strikethrough~~.
```

You can [link to another page](/getting-started/).

```md
You can [link to another page](/getting-started/).
```

You can highlight `inline code` with backticks.

```md
You can highlight `inline code` with backticks.
```

## Images

Images in Starlight use [Astro’s built-in optimized asset support](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/).

Markdown and MDX support the Markdown syntax for displaying images that includes alt-text for screen readers and assistive technology.

```md
![An illustration of planets and stars featuring the word “astro”](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/withastro/docs/main/public/default-og-image.png)
```

Relative image paths are also supported for images stored locally in your project.

```md
// src/content/docs/page-1.md

![A rocketship in space](../../assets/images/rocket.svg)
```

## Headings

You can structure content using a heading. Headings in Markdown are indicated by a number of `#` at the start of the line.

### How to structure page content in Starlight

Starlight is configured to automatically use your page title as a top-level heading and will include an "Overview" heading at top of each page's table of contents. We recommend starting each page with regular paragraph text content and using on-page headings from `<h2>` and down:

```md
---
title: Markdown Guide
description: How to use Markdown in Starlight
---

This page describes how to use Markdown in Starlight.

## Inline Styles

## Headings
```

### Automatic heading anchor links

Using headings in Markdown will automatically give you anchor links so you can link directly to certain sections of your page:

```md
---
title: My page of content
description: How to use Starlight's built-in anchor links
---

## Introduction

I can link to [my conclusion](#conclusion) lower on the same page.

## Conclusion

`https://my-site.com/page1/#introduction` navigates directly to my Introduction.
```

Level 2 (`<h2>`) and Level 3 (`<h3>`) headings will automatically appear in the page table of contents.

Learn more about how Astro processes heading `id`s in [the Astro Documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#heading-ids)

## Asides

Asides (also known as “admonitions” or “callouts”) are useful for displaying secondary information alongside a page’s main content.

Starlight provides a custom Markdown syntax for rendering asides. Aside blocks are indicated using a pair of triple colons `:::` to wrap your content, and can be of type `note`, `tip`, `caution` or `danger`.

You can nest any other Markdown content types inside an aside, but asides are best suited to short and concise chunks of content.

### Note aside

:::note
Starlight is a documentation website toolkit built with [Astro](https://astro.build/). You can get started with this command:

```sh
npm create astro@latest -- --template starlight
```

### Custom aside titles

You can specify a custom title for the aside in square brackets following the aside type, e.g. `:::tip[Did you know?]`.

:::tip[Did you know?]
Astro helps you build faster websites with [“Islands Architecture”](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/).
:::

```md
:::tip[Did you know?]
Astro helps you build faster websites with [“Islands Architecture”](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/).
:::
```

### Custom aside icons

You can specify a custom icon for the aside in curly brackets following the aside type or [custom title](#custom-aside-titles), e.g. `:::tip{icon="heart"}` or `:::tip[Did you know?]{icon="heart"}` respectively.
The icon name must be set to the name of [one of Starlight’s built-in icons](/reference/icons/#all-icons).

:::tip{icon="heart"}
Astro helps you build faster websites with [“Islands Architecture”](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/).
:::

```md
:::tip{icon="heart"}
Astro helps you build faster websites with [“Islands Architecture”](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/).
:::
```

### More aside types

Caution and danger asides are helpful for drawing a user’s attention to details that may trip them up.
If you find yourself using these a lot, it may also be a sign that the thing you are documenting could benefit from being redesigned.

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote, which is commonly used when quoting another person or document.
>
> Blockquotes are indicated by a `>` at the start of each line.

```md

>
> Blockquotes are indicated by a `>` at the start of each line.
```

## Code blocks

A code block is indicated by a block with three backticks <code>```</code> at the start and end. You can indicate the programming language being used after the opening backticks.

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
	dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l);
	return true;
};
```

````md
```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
	dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l);
	return true;
};
```
````

### Expressive Code features

Starlight uses [Expressive Code](https://expressive-code.com/) to extend formatting possibilities for code blocks.
Expressive Code’s text markers and window frames plugins are enabled by default.
Code block rendering can be configured using Starlight’s [`expressiveCode` configuration option](/reference/configuration/#expressivecode).

#### Text markers

You can highlight specific lines or parts of your code blocks using [Expressive Code text markers](https://expressive-code.com/key-features/text-markers/) on the opening line of your code block.
Use curly braces (`{ }`) to highlight entire lines, and quotation marks to highlight strings of text.

There are three highlighting styles: neutral for calling attention to code, green for indicating inserted code, and red for indicating deleted code.
Both text and entire lines can be marked using the default marker, or in combination with `ins=` and `del=` to produce the desired highlighting.

Expressive Code provides several options for customizing the visual appearance of your code samples.
Many of these can be combined, for highly illustrative code samples.
Please explore the [Expressive Code documentation](https://expressive-code.com/key-features/text-markers/#configuration) for the extensive options available.
Some of the most common examples are shown below:

- [Mark entire lines & line ranges using the `{ }` marker](https://expressive-code.com/key-features/text-markers/#marking-full-lines--line-ranges):

  ```js {2-3}

  	return 'This is line #3 of this snippet';
  }
  ```

  <Tabs syncKey="content-type">

  	return 'This is line #3 of this snippet';
  }
  ```
  ````

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Markdoc">

  ````markdoc
  ```js {% meta="{2-3}" %}

- [Mark selections of text using the `" "` marker or regular expressions](https://expressive-code.com/key-features/text-markers/#marking-individual-text-inside-lines):

  ```js "Individual terms" /Even.*supported/
  // Individual terms can be highlighted, too
  function demo() {
  	return 'Even regular expressions are supported';
  }
  ```

  <Tabs syncKey="content-type">

  <TabItem label="Markdown/MDX">

  ````md
  ```js "Individual terms" /Even.*supported/

  </TabItem>

  </Tabs>

- [Mark text or lines as inserted or deleted with `ins` or `del`](https://expressive-code.com/key-features/text-markers/#selecting-inline-marker-types-mark-ins-del):

  ```js "return true;" ins="inserted" del="deleted"

  	console.log('These are inserted and deleted marker types');
  	// The return statement uses the default marker type
  	return true;
  }
  ```

  <Tabs syncKey="content-type">

  <TabItem label="Markdown/MDX">

  ````md
  ```js "return true;" ins="inserted" del="deleted"

- [Combine syntax highlighting with `diff`-like syntax](https://expressive-code.com/key-features/text-markers/#combining-syntax-highlighting-with-diff-like-syntax):

  ```diff lang="js"
    function thisIsJavaScript() {
      // This entire block gets highlighted as JavaScript,
      // and we can still add diff markers to it!

  -   console.log('Old code to be removed')
  +   console.log('New and shiny code!')
    }
  ```
  ````

  </TabItem>

  </Tabs>

#### Frames and titles

Code blocks can be rendered inside a window-like frame.
A frame that looks like a terminal window will be used for shell scripting languages (e.g. `bash` or `sh`).
Other languages display inside a code editor-style frame if they include a title.

A code block’s optional title can be set either with a `title="..."` attribute following the code block's opening backticks and language identifier, or with a file name comment in the first lines of the code.

- [Add a file name tab with a comment](https://expressive-code.com/key-features/frames/#code-editor-frames)

  ```js
  // my-test-file.js
  console.log('Hello World!');
  ```

  <Tabs syncKey="content-type">

  <TabItem label="Markdown/MDX">

  ````md
  ```js
  // my-test-file.js
  console.log('Hello World!');
  ```
  ````

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Markdoc">

  ````md
  ```js
  // my-test-file.js
  console.log('Hello World!');
  ```
  ````

  </TabItem>

  </Tabs>

- [Add a title to a Terminal window](https://expressive-code.com/key-features/frames/#terminal-frames)

  ```bash title="Installing dependencies…"
  npm install
  ```

  <Tabs syncKey="content-type">

  <TabItem label="Markdown/MDX">

  ```bash frame="none"
  echo "This is not rendered as a terminal despite using the bash language"
  ```

  <Tabs syncKey="content-type">

  <TabItem label="Markdown/MDX">

  ````md
  ```bash frame="none"
  echo "This is not rendered as a terminal despite using the bash language"
  ```
  ````

  ```bash {% frame="none" %}
  echo "This is not rendered as a terminal despite using the bash language"
  ```
  ````

  </TabItem>

  </Tabs>

## Details

Details (also known as “disclosures” or “accordions”) are useful to hide content that is not immediately relevant.
Users can click a short summary to expand and view the full content.

Use the standard HTML [`<details>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details) and [`<summary>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/summary) elements in your Markdown content to create a disclosure widget.

You can nest any other Markdown syntax inside a `<details>` element.

<details>
<summary>Where and when is the Andromeda constellation most visible?</summary>

The [Andromeda constellation](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_(constellation)>) is most visible in the night sky during the month of November at latitudes between `+90°` and `−40°`.

</details>

```md
<details>
<summary>Where and when is the Andromeda constellation most visible?</summary>

The [Andromeda constellation](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_(constellation)>) is most visible in the night sky during the month of November at latitudes between `+90°` and `−40°`.

</details>
```

## Footnotes

[Footnotes](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#footnotes) are useful for adding brief references or clarifications without interrupting the flow of your content. They appear as numbered superscript links that jump to referenced text collected at the bottom of the page.

Define a footnote using square brackets with a caret and numbered reference:

```md
Here is a footnote[^1] with some additional text after it.

[^1]: My reference.
```

## Other common Markdown features

Starlight supports all other Markdown authoring syntax, such as lists and tables. See the [Markdown Cheat Sheet from The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for a quick overview of all the Markdown syntax elements.

## Advanced Markdown and MDX configuration

Starlight uses Astro’s Markdown and MDX renderer built on remark and rehype. You can add support for custom syntax and behavior by adding `remarkPlugins` or `rehypePlugins` in your Astro config file. See [“Markdown Plugins”](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#markdown-plugins) in the Astro docs to learn more.

## Markdoc

Starlight supports authoring content in Markdoc using the experimental [Astro Markdoc integration](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/markdoc/) and the Starlight Markdoc preset.

### Create a new project with Markdoc

Start a new Starlight project with Markdoc pre-configured using `create astro`:

import { Tabs, TabItem, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Tabs syncKey="pkg">
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
npm create astro@latest -- --template starlight/markdoc
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm create astro --template starlight/markdoc
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Yarn">

```sh
yarn create astro --template starlight/markdoc
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Add Markdoc to an existing project

If you already have a Starlight site and want to add Markdoc, follow these steps.

<Steps>

1.  Add Astro’s Markdoc integration:

    <Tabs syncKey="pkg">

    <TabItem label="npm">

    ```sh
    npx astro add markdoc
    ```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="pnpm">

    ```sh
    pnpm astro add markdoc
    ```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="Yarn">

    ```sh
    yarn astro add markdoc
    ```

    </TabItem>

    </Tabs>

2.  Install the Starlight Markdoc preset:

    <Tabs syncKey="pkg">

    <TabItem label="npm">

    ```sh
    npm install @astrojs/starlight-markdoc
    ```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="pnpm">

    ```sh
    pnpm add @astrojs/starlight-markdoc
    ```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="Yarn">

    ```sh
    yarn add @astrojs/starlight-markdoc
    ```

    </TabItem>

    </Tabs>

3.  Create a Markdoc configuration file at `markdoc.config.mjs` and use the Starlight Markdoc preset:

    ```js
    import { defineMarkdocConfig } from '@astrojs/markdoc/config';
    import starlightMarkdoc from '@astrojs/starlight-markdoc';

    export default defineMarkdocConfig({
    	extends: [starlightMarkdoc()],
    });
    ```

</Steps>

To learn more about the Markdoc syntax and features, see the [Markdoc documentation](https://markdoc.dev/docs/syntax) or the [Astro Markdoc integration guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/markdoc/).

### Configuring the Markdoc preset

The `starlightMarkdoc()` preset accepts the following configuration options:

#### `headingLinks`

**type:** `boolean`  
**default:** `true`

Controls whether or not headings are rendered with a clickable anchor link.
Equivalent to the [`markdown.headingLinks`](/reference/configuration/#markdown) option, which applies to Markdown and MDX files.

```js "headingLinks: false"
export default defineMarkdocConfig({
	// Disable the default heading anchor link support
	extends: [starlightMarkdoc({ headingLinks: false })],
});
```
