Starlight provides a set of built-in icons that you can display in your content using the `<Icon>` component.

## Use icons

Icons can be displayed using the [`<Icon>`](/components/icons/) component.
They are also often used in other components, such as [cards](/components/cards/) or settings like [hero actions](/reference/frontmatter/#hero).

## All icons

A list of all available icons is shown below with their associated names. Click an icon to copy its name to your clipboard.

import IconsList from '~/components/icons-list.astro';

<IconsList labels={{ copied: 'Copied!' }} />
