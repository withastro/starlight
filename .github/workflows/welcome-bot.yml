            Hello! Thank you for opening your **first PR** to Starlight! ✨

            Here’s what will happen next:

            1. Our GitHub bots will run to check your changes.
               If they spot any issues you will see some error messages on this PR.
               Don’t hesitate to ask any questions if you’re not sure what these mean!

            2. In a few minutes, you’ll be able to see a preview of your changes on Netlify 🤩

            3. One or more of our maintainers will take a look and may ask you to make changes.
               We try to be responsive, but don’t worry if this takes a few days.
