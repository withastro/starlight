'@astrojs/starlight': minor
---

Updates the `astro-expressive-code` dependency to the latest version (0.38).

The new version allows using `ec.config.mjs` to selectively override individual Expressive Code styles and settings provided by Starlight themes and plugins, speeds up Shiki language loading, and adds the config option `expressiveCode.shiki.injectLangsIntoNestedCodeBlocks`. See the [Expressive Code release notes](https://expressive-code.com/releases/#0380) for full details.
