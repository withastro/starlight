'@astrojs/starlight': minor
---

Add the `@astrojs/sitemap` and `@astrojs/mdx` integrations only if they are not detected in the Astro configuration.

⚠️ **BREAKING CHANGE** The minimum supported version of Astro is now v3.2.0. Make sure you update Astro at the same time as updating Starlight:

```sh
npm install astro@latest
```
