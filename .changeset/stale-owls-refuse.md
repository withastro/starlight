Bump minimum required Astro version to 3.0

⚠️ **BREAKING CHANGE** Astro v2 is no longer supported. Make sure you update [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/upgrade-to/v3/), [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/#updating-starlight), and any other integrations at the same time as updating the Tailwind plugin.
