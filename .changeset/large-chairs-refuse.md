'@astrojs/starlight': patch
---

Fixes a trailing slash inconsistency in generated sidebar links when using the [`trailingSlash: 'ignore'`](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/configuration-reference/#trailingslash) Astro option (the default) between [internal](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/sidebar/#internal-links) and [auto-generated](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/sidebar/#autogenerated-groups) links. Starlight behavior for this configuration value is to use a trailing slash as many common hosting providers redirect to URLs with a trailing slash by default.
