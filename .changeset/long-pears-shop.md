Updates minimum Pagefind dependency to v1.3.0, sets new defaults for Pagefind’s ranking options, and adds support for manually configuring the ranking options

The new ranking option defaults have been evaluated against Starlight’s own docs to improve the quality of search results. See [“Customize Pagefind's result ranking”](https://pagefind.app/docs/ranking/) for more details about how they work.
