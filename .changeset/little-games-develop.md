Add support for Astro v4, drop support for Astro v3

⚠️ **BREAKING CHANGE** Astro v3 is no longer supported. Make sure you [update Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/upgrade-to/v4/) and any other integrations at the same time as updating Starlight.

Use the new `@astrojs/upgrade` command to upgrade Astro and Starlight together:

```sh
npx @astrojs/upgrade
```
