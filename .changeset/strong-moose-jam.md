Updates `astro-expressive-code` dependency to the latest minor release (0.34) and exposes a new `@astrojs/starlight/expressive-code/hast` module for users who need to use Expressive Code’s version of `hast`.

This is a potentially breaking change if you use custom Expressive Code plugins. See the [Expressive Code release notes](https://expressive-code.com/releases/#0340) for full details.
