Ensures that Starlight CSS layer order is predictable in custom pages using the `<StarlightPage>` component.

Previously, due to how [import order](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/styling/#import-order) works in Astro, the `<StarlightPage>` component had to be the first import in custom pages to set up [cascade layers](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/css-and-tailwind/#cascade-layers) used internally by Starlight to manage the order of its styles.

With this change, this restriction no longer applies and Starlightâ€™s styles will be applied correctly regardless of the import order of the `<StarlightPage>` component.
