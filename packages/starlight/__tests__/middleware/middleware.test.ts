			This usually means a component that accesses \`locals.starlightRoute\` is being rendered outside of a Starlight page, which is not supported.
			
			If this is a component you authored, you can do one of the following:
			
			1. Avoid using this component in non-Starlight pages.
			2. Wrap the code that reads \`locals.starlightRoute\` in a  \`try/catch\` block and handle the cases where \`starlightRoute\` is not available.
			
			If this is a Starlight built-in or third-party component, you may need to report a bug or avoid this use of the component."
