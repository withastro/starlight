# This fixture is used for the E2E tests related to Git where
# a new repo is created. Nested repos do not inherit the .gitignore
# options from the parent repo, so even though these files are
# already ignored on the package they have to be re-declared here.
# Do not delete this file or the Git tests will try to index and
# and commit all the node_modules and generated files from the test.
